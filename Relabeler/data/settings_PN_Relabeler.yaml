# Settings for the script Datasets_PN_Relabeler.py

## Part 1) Uncomment these settings for developing the training, validation and test splits of the PN Relabeling development dataset.
## ~~~!!!~~~ PN Relabeling Dataset development for PN Relabeling model development and train/val/test split ~~~!!!~~~
##                       ~~~!!!~~~
# taskName: A string representing the specific experiment. This will be used as a prefix in generated folders.
taskName: 'f2005_full'
# detailsSCL: String name of the original CSV file with with all SCL descriptors (e.g. filtering_2005_descriptors.csv), as generated by the data-preparation script
detailsSCL: 'filtering_2005_descriptors.csv'
# inputFile: String name of the original JSON file with with all articles (e.g. filtering_2005.json), as generated by the data-preparation script
inputFile: 'filtering_2005.json'
# golenLabelField: String name of the JSON field (e.g. "Descriptor_UIs") to get the golden/ground-truth labels from the inputFile.
golenLabelField: 'Descriptor_UIs'
# weakLabelField: String name of the JSON field (e.g. "weakLabel") to get the weak/heuristic labels from the inputFile.
weakLabelField: 'weakLabel'
# datasetType: A flag indicating the task of interest: "NWL" stands for the PN relabelling task on "Negative Weak Labels" (TN vs FN)
datasetType: 'NWL'
# workingPath: The path for the folder where all results will be stored. The folder should be already available in the file system and contain the inputFile and detailsSCL files.
workingPath: '...\FN_2005_full'
# keptInstanceRatio: A float value representing the ratio of Fasle Negative (FN) documents (and only FN documents) to be kept during undersampling. For value 1.0 no FN undersampling is applied.
keptInstanceRatio: 1
# testRatio: A float value representing the ratio of the dataset to be considered for test in train/dev/test split (e.g. 0.2). For value 1.0 it considers the whole dataset as test.
testRatio: 0.2
# devRatio: A float value representing the ratio of the dataset to be considered for development
devRatio: 0.2
# chunk_size: An integer value representing the number of labels to be considered for each independent dataset. When 1, each label will be stored in a distinct folder.
chunk_size: 1
# statsOnly: When true, writing the dataset files is skipped. This is when only statistics calculation on label frequencies is needed.
statsOnly: false

## Part 2) Uncomment these settings for developing the test files for using a PN Relabeler model for the generation of predictions on the FGSI task.
## ~~~!!!~~~ FGSI test Dataset development for prediction/extrinsic evaluation ~~~!!!~~~

#inputFile: 'test_2019.json'
## detailsSCL: String name of the original CSV file with with all Fine-Grained descriptors (e.g. UseCasesSelected_2019.csv), as generated by the RetroBM script. It is more convenient to use a single name for all runs (e.g. 'FP_SCL_selected.csv').
