    - The development of a *PN Relabeler* model on the *𝑃𝑁 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 dataset*.
    - The application of the *PN Relabeler* model to relabel predictions for the FGSI task.

## How to use
Use as described in steps 3, 5, and 6 in the [**Relabeler**](../) project.
  
## Requirements
These scripts are written in Python 3.9.7.
